# Standard Steps in a Machine Learning Project

A typical machine learning project follows a structured workflow to ensure reproducibility, efficiency, and successful model deployment. Below are the standard steps:

## 1. Problem Definition
- Understand the business/problem objective.
- Define the goal (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
- Identify success metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.).

## 2. Data Collection
- Gather data from relevant sources (databases, APIs, web scraping, etc.).
- Ensure data is representative of the problem.
- Label data if supervised learning is involved.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
### a. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze data distributions, missing values, and outliers.
- Visualize relationships between features (heatmaps, histograms, etc.).
### b. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values (imputation, removal).
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant data.
- Correct inconsistencies (e.g., typos in categorical data).
### c. Feature Engineering
- Create new features from raw data.
- Encode categorical variables (one-hot, label encoding).
- Normalize/standardize numerical features.
- Handle imbalanced data (SMOTE, undersampling, etc.).

## 4. Model Selection & Training
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Select baseline models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.).
- Train models using the training set.
- Tune hyperparameters (GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV, Bayesian Optimization).

## 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate performance on validation/test sets using metrics like:
  - **Classification**: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
  - **Regression**: MSE, RMSE, RÂ².
- Compare models and select the best-performing one.
- Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.

## 6. Model Deployment
- Save the trained model (pickle, ONNX, or joblib).
- Deploy as an API (Flask, FastAPI) or integrate into applications.
- Containerize using Docker for scalability.

## 7. Monitoring & Maintenance
- Track model performance in production.
- Retrain models periodically with new data.
- Handle concept drift and data shifts.

## 8. Documentation & Reporting
- Document the process, assumptions, and results.
- Share insights with stakeholders via reports/dashboards.
