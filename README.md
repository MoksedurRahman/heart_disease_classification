Heart Disease Classification: Predicting Cardiovascular Risk with Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify the presence of heart disease based on patient health metrics. Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early prediction plays a crucial role in saving lives.

ðŸ“Œ Objective
To build and evaluate classification models that can accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease using structured health data, enabling better preventive healthcare decisions.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used in this project is based on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, one of the most commonly used datasets in medical machine learning.

Features include:

- Age

- Sex

- Chest pain type (cp)

- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)

- Serum cholesterol (chol)

- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)

- Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)

- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)

- Exercise-induced angina (exang)

- ST depression (oldpeak)

- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)

- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca)

- Thalassemia (thal)


*Target variable:*

- 0: No heart disease

- 1: Presence of heart disease
