# 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

This document outlines the standard steps followed in a machine learning project. It serves as a checklist and guide throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## 1. 📌 Problem Definition
- Understand the business/research problem
- Identify type of ML: Supervised / Unsupervised / Reinforcement
- Define the task: Classification / Regression / Clustering / etc.

---

## 2. 📥 Data Collection
- Source data from databases, files, APIs, or scraping
- Ensure data relevance and representativeness

---

## 3. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Handle outliers
- Convert categorical to numerical (e.g., one-hot encoding)
- Normalize / Standardize

---

## 4. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize data distributions and relationships
- Identify trends and anomalies
- Correlation matrix, pair plots, histograms, etc.

---

## 5. 🧪 Feature Engineering
- Select important features
- Create new features
- Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)

---

## 6. ✂️ Data Splitting
- Split dataset into:
  - Training set
  - Validation set (optional)
  - Test set

---

## 7. 🤖 Model Selection
- Choose algorithm(s) based on problem type
- Consider interpretability, complexity, scalability

---

## 8. 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training
- Train model on training data
- Monitor learning curves and overfitting

---

## 9. 📏 Model Evaluation
- Use test/validation set
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC
  - Regression: RMSE, MAE, R²

---

## 10. 🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization
- Cross-validation for robustness

---

## 11. 🚀 Model Deployment *(optional for study projects)*
- Package model using Pickle, ONNX, etc.
- Create REST API with Flask / FastAPI
- Deploy to cloud or local server

---

## 12. 📡 Monitoring & Maintenance *(optional for study projects)*
- Monitor performance over time
- Schedule retraining if data drifts
